# Got Your Back

This project contains code written in relation to our bachelor project at NTNU. Our assignment is to classify sitting postures with machine learning algorithms on accelerometer- and gyroscope-data. The datasets are recorded using sensors from LP-RESEARCH, and provided in this repository. Additionally, we have developed an electron app for recording data and live-classify your sitting posture over time.

#### Releases:

For cloning:
As we depend on another repo for the OpenZen-library, you have to clone the project with the submodules included. The following line will fix this for you:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OleJonas/Got-Your-Back.git 'GotYourBack'`

TODO:
Create releases for both windows and mac and upload
