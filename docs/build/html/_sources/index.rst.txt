Welcome to Got Your Back's documentation!
=========================================

This is the API documentation for code written in the project Got Your Back. The main goal of the methods and code provided is to connect and collect data from sensors provided by `LP-RESEARCH
<https://lp-research.com>`_, classify sitting postures in realtime using machine learning algorithms - and give a user the possibility to control all this in an application provided by us.
