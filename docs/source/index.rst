Backend API Documentation
==========================

This is the API documentation for code written in the project Got Your Back. 
The main goal of the code provided is to connect and collect data 
from sensors provided by `LP-RESEARCH <https://lp-research.com>`_, and to classify 
sitting postures in realtime using machine learning algorithms. This project's 
API is divided into two parts; one for the sensor handling, data collection and 
classification in Python, and one for the frontend application in React Typescript. 
This is the backend api.
